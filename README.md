# 3D touch typing game
My final project for the Full Stack Web Dev course at [Spiced Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com).

### Aim
In 5 days, build a small game that would help me (and potentially anyone) to increase touch typing speed.

### Description.
A cube is displayed in the center of the screen. Once the game commenes, the cube will rotate 90 degrees in a randomly chosen direction (up, down, left, right), at a specified interval. Each rotation displays a new character, which you must type before the cube rotates again. With each successfully typed character, your score is increased by 1. When a max score of 10 is reached, the interval between rotations decreases and the score is reset to zero. Once seven reductions in interval have been completed, the level is increased. There are 8 levels to the game. Level 1 requires you to type only those keys that can be reached with your left index finger. Level 2 requires these same keys with the addition of those keys that can be reached with yuor right index finger. Level 3 then adds those keys of your left middle finger, and so on.

### Libraries.
React, React Spring, React Three Fiber, Three js.
